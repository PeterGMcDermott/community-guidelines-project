Community Guidelines
====================

A Live Template Document for Google+ Community Moderators
---------------------------------------------------------

Growing a community takes a lot of patience, but most importantly a lot of work. Because most of the community moderators within Google+ are creating communities on their own personal time, it only makes sense that we work together to create the tools we need to grow and maintain successful communities.

There are three elements that a community needs to flourish: safety, freedom and harmony. Your community members need to feel safe when they are there. They need to know that their conversation is taken seriously and that the trolls are kept at bay. However, your community members also need freedom to share their thoughts, ideas and experiences. As moderators, we must be careful that we are not over-moderating our communities and making the members feel like they cannot share. We must ensure that we are clear with the sets of rules that govern our communities so our community members can share and discuss in harmony.

The purpose of this document is to create and improve upon a general set of community guidelines that all community moderators can adopt and tweak for their individual communities. By working on this project together, we will be rewarded with a comprehensive and valuable tool that we can all use freely to help improve our communities.
